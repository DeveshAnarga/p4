Comprehensive Security Assessment and Threat Modeling : Assignment

I conducted penetration testing on the virtual machine "BASIC PENTESTING: 1" 
Successfully pinpointing three vulnerabilities in the VM. The resulting report featured an Executive Summary, 
offering concise insights into the achieved penetration testing goals. The Vulnerability List included a thorough assessment of severity, and the
detailed vulnerabilities were presented with step-by-step guides for exploitation, enriched with pertinent screenshots. In parallel, the assignment 
involved threat modeling for a pharmaceutical company's diagnostic system. This encompassed creating a Data Flow Diagram (DFD), delineating trust boundaries, and 
formulating mitigation strategies for three threats, including Information Disclosure. My approach was rooted in meticulous analysis, contributing to 
a robust understanding of penetration testing and threat modeling methodologies.
